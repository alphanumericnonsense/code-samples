# Examples of this and that

Some coding examples mostly from cryptography and related areas in Python, C, and VHDL.  There's nothing all that good or useful because

1. I want to avoid being frivolously sued by my previous employer[^leavemealone] and
2. I'm not much of a programmer.

There's nothing here that I couldn't reproduce from scratch in a few days.  However, it should serve to demonstrate that I can take ideas and turn them into code that runs, whether it be scripted, compiled, or hardware.

## Notes

I am the sole author of the material here, with the exception of a few scripts (namely `CompactFIPS202.py`, `aes_ctr_drbg.py`, and `ascon_ref.py`), the KAT files for Kyber/Dilithium, and some subroutines in the `foobar-with-google` examples.

All of the material here falls outside of "...confidential and proprietary information, trade secrets, and inventions related to <company>â€™s business or related to your work for <company>."  No inventions here, no original thought whatsoever!  There is absolutely nothing concerning power analysis, PUFs, memory encryption, or anti-tamper, or whatever <company> thinks its business is.

- `c-examples/`.   None of this material was written for or used by my previous employer.
- `foobar-with-google/`.  None of this material was written for or used by my previous employer.  None of it is even in the same realm of discourse.
- `vhdl-examples/`.  Absolutely nothing proprietary.  Anyone who can read the specification documents and write VHDL could write any of the crypto here in a day.  The other examples are even more trivial.
- `python-examples/`.  I really don't think anyone can claim ownership of the Euclidean algorithm, finite fields, or DFT (not even the ghosts of Euclid, Galois, or Fourier), of standard error-correction techniques and algorithms, of sorting algorithms cribbed from textbooks, of public crypto specifications, etc.   There's nothing proprietary about linear regression!
- `foobar-with-google/`.  Coding fun entirely disjoint from my 9-to-5.

[^leavemealone]: None of this material falls under "confidential and proprietary information, trade secrets, and inventions."  It's literally trash, bad implementations of publicly available specifications, basic algorithms, and simple mathematical trinkets demonstrating nothing more than my ability to read and obey some rules of syntax.
